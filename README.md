## 💼 Database Design

### Questions Table
| Column | Type | Description |
|------|------|------------|
| id | Integer | Primary key |
| question_text | String | Quiz question text |

### Choices Table
| Column | Type | Description |
|------|------|------------|
| id | Integer | Primary key |
| choice_text | String | Choice text |
| is_correct | Boolean | Indicates correct answer |
| questions_id | Integer | Foreign key → questions.id |

Each question can have **multiple choices**, and each choice belongs to a single question.

  "choices": [
    { "choice_text": "Python web framework", "is_correct": true },
    { "choice_text": "Database", "is_correct": false }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Get Question by ID
**GET** `/questions/{question_id}`

Returns a single question by its ID.

## 🧩 API Documentation
Interactive API documentation is automatically generated by FastAPI and available at:

`http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`

---

## 🔧 Database Configuration
The database connection is configured in `database.py` using SQLAlchemy:

`URL_DATABASE = "postgresql://<username>:<password>@localhost:5432/<database_name>"`

**Note: In production environments, database credentials should be stored securely using environment variables.**

## ▶️ Running the Project Locally
1. Clone the repository
2. Create and activate a virtual environment
3. Install dependencies
4. Start the FastAPI server

`uvicorn main:app --reload`

---

## 📌 Project Status
 - Database schema designed and implemented

 - FastAPI application setup completed

 - APIs for creating and retrieving questions and choices implemented

 - Tested using Swagger UI

This project serves as a solid backend foundation and can be extended with features such as authentication, quiz attempts, scoring, and user management.
